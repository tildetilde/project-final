Banganza â€“ Final Project
Banganza is an interactive multiplayer quiz game where teams compete by placing items in the correct order on a timeline. Categories include animals, elements, internet phenomena, and more. The project was built as a final assignment to demonstrate full-stack development with React, TypeScript, Node.js and MongoDB.

The problem
The goal was to create a fully functioning game that combines accessibility, design, and game mechanics in one app.
Key challenges included state management for multiple teams, drag-and-drop interactions, and an admin interface for managing categories and items.

Technologies and tools used:
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, custom UI components
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
Features: JWT authentication, admin panel for CRUD operations, accessible design with ARIA and keyboard support, animated intro and transitions

Planning involved sketching wireframes, defining game phases, and structuring code with clean practices and reusable components.

If there was more time, next steps would include:
Adding live multiplayer with WebSockets
More categories and item sets
Enhanced animations and sounds
Analytics and scoring history
